School Event Organizer (also known as Scevor) is a platform that eases the staff coordination in school events, such as end of school parties or tournaments of basketball. The platform is made by two parts: the frontend, a Flutter app, interfaces with a backend server hosted in the school network.

Scevor has many features:

- Announcements, made by the organizers
  
- Chats between the staff member and the organizers and between the group members
  
- School map (if added by the organizers)
  
- Live stream (if available and scheduled by the organizers)
  
- Timetable of the event (if added by the organizers)
  
  Other features will be announced later in our GitHub page: https://github.com/scevor
  

We'll do our best to ensure the compliance with GDPR, because public administrations in Italy have very strict rules regarding personal data processing. Our goal is that no personal data should exit from the school's network.

The application and the components that we will make will be released with an open source licence.

This project has been inspired by the End of School party organization that has been made in ITI Severi (Padua) in 2023.
